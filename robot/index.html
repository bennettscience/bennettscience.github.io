			<div class="content">
				<div class="text">
					<p>Teachers have a unique opportunity each year - you get new students!</p>
					<p>While great, it takes time to get to know one another. Consider recording a short "this is me" video to give to your students to introduce yourself. It doesn't have to be fancy, but it starts the relationship-building process immediately.</p>
					<h2>From the creator:</h2>
					<i>When I was a student in this class, I was very bored and I had to memorize everything... So I decided to studied more about how to teach more effective and experience it in the classroom. I believe that this course (Aesthetics and Art History) is the most important course for freshman in architecture school and it should be blended in order to be more effective. My students and I would have time in class to discuss and debate together instead of been passive and just listening.</i>

			<div class="title"><h1>Leaving Feedback</h1></div>
			<div class="content">
				<div class="text">
					<p>Videos can be more than direct instruction. Currently, how do you give feedback on assignments?</p>
					<p>It takes a lot of time, right?</p>
					<p>Video can be used to give direct feedback to the student because it communicates areas of improvement more effectively than written feedback alone.</p>
					<h2>From the creator:</h2>
					<i>Giving feedback on writing isn't easy to do in snippets on the margins. I need to sit down and conference with my students, but I don't always have time to do that in class. Recording a short video lets me elaborate on feedback in addition to leaving notes. An added bonus is that students can listen to the feedback multiple times during the revision process.</i>

			<div class="title"><h1>No Broken Records</h1></div>
			<div class="content">
				<div class="text">
					<p>Have you ever repeated yourself, answering the same question multiple times?</p>
					<p>If you've got an iPad, you can use a whiteboard app to record the answer <i>once</i>, and then share it out so other students can benefit.</p>
					<p>Make sure you record the discussion as well! Don't stop with the answer. Hearing follow-up conversation can help clarify confusing points.</p>
					<h2>From the creator:</h2>
					<i>I use videos so people can see and hear the human side of the tech department, because I want teachers to develop a connection with me, not a user manual, and so I can model the type of digital media creation I want my teachers to explore.</i>

			<div class="title"><h1>Handling Absences</h1></div>
			<div class="content">
				<div class="text">
					<p>Plannning for an absence is harder work than planning for a normal class. How do you leave clear instructions?</p>
					<p>With a video, students get the instructions from <b>you</b>, not from an explanation sheet. They hear your voice, your inflection, and your description as they normally would.</p>
					<p>After a five-minute description, they can jump right into working, which means the time is more productive.</p>
					<h2>From the creator:</h2>
					<i>Teacher-produced screencasts help my students make progress regardless of where I am physically located. I can be a few feet or a few hundred miles away from the classroom and still have an impact on the learning taking place. I like to call it "outsource yourself to yourself" since only you can make the best clone of yourself for every student!</i>

			<div class="title"><h1>Project Instructions</h1></div>
			<div class="content">
				<div class="text">
				    <p>Activities, projects, and labs take up a lot of class time with instructions. You need to give safety information, background, and expectations. Then, you end up answering those same questions as students work through the task.</p>
				    <p>Many times, this introductory information can be done with a video. Students get the instructions quickly and concisely and can refer back to it as often as they need to.</p>
				    <h2>From the creator:</h2>
				    <i>Using videos gives students more independence in lab and allows them to optimize the time they have available.  The video may give details about the lab challenge and/or instruction on how to use unfamiliar equipment. They can refer back to it as needed while performing the lab instead of having to wait for me to make it to their station to answer questions.</i>

			<div class="title"><h1>Show Your Work</h1></div>
			<div class="content">
				<div class="text">
					<p>Using a webcam (or picture in picture) is a great way to reinforce your role as the instructor for your content.</p>
					<p>Remember, if you teach a purely online course, you may never meet your students face to face. An introduction video is a great way to begin building a relationship, but including your image in instruction can carry more weight than a video with no image. A significant amount of communication is non-verbal, and your students miss out on that if they can't see you.</p>
					<h2>From the creator:</h2>
					<i>I've always made videos with the webcam because my students told me they preferred it that way. It helps us form connections quickly in class, and adds a personal touch to what would otherwise be stale instruction.</i>
